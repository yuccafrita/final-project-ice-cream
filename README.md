## visualization after-thoughts
I chose ice cream simply because I tasted really good gelato while on vacation in Abu Dhabi.  It was a local owned shop called Gelato Divino.  http://gelatodivino.com/en/ I did notice the price of the gelato was very expensive there and confirmed it by doing research online.   What interested me in the topic is what would drive a consumer to buy ice cream. 

Before taking this class, I never thought about mapping would be useful.  I really enjoyed the map design principles and the variety of options to customize a map.  I wish I had more time to play with the scrolling story map and hover over polygon maps.   Thank you for providing simple to understand instructions using free tools like Google Docs/Sheets, Github, Leaflets and Highcharts.  It surprised me that I can create visuals with just a little bit of coding on Github.  I definitely think there is potential to advance my skills in data visualization.  I only learned just the surface level of what these free softwares can do. I can only imagine how much more there is via other open source data sources, Tableau, API, Pull, Socratas, etc.  My next step would be to familiarize myself with Tableau as I recently got the application at my workplace.
